# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple and powerful To-Do List application built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The goal of this project is to help users manage their daily tasks more efficiently. It offers features like task creation, editing, searching, task highlighting, reminders, and more. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and smooth, making task management a breeze.

## Features

### 1. Create New Tasks
You can easily add new tasks to your list by entering the task name and a short description. Each task will have a unique name, and the app prevents adding duplicate tasks. This ensures that all tasks are easily identifiable.

### 2. Edit Tasks
If you need to change a task after creating it, you can easily edit the task. Simply click the "Edit" button next to the task, make your changes, and save them. This allows you to keep your task list updated with the latest information.

### 3. Search for Tasks
The search feature lets you quickly find tasks by their name. If your task list grows too long, this functionality helps you locate any task easily without scrolling through the entire list.

### 4. Highlight Important Tasks
You can mark tasks as "Important" or "Highlighted" by selecting the task and clicking the "Highlight" button. This helps you distinguish high-priority tasks from others, keeping you focused on what matters most.

### 5. Set Reminders for Tasks
You can set reminders for specific tasks, ensuring that you don’t forget important deadlines. The reminders can be set based on time intervals like hours, minutes, or even seconds. Once the set time is up, you will get notified, reminding you about the task.

### 6. Prevent Duplicate Entries
To keep your list clean and free from clutter, the app automatically prevents adding duplicate tasks. This way, you don’t need to worry about repeating task names accidentally.

### 7. Delete Tasks
Completed or unnecessary tasks can be removed from the list with just a click. Simply select the tasks you want to delete, and click the "Delete" button. This helps you keep your to-do list organized.

## User Interface

The user interface is clean, minimalistic, and responsive. It ensures that the user experience is smooth and distraction-free. Some key features of the interface include:

- **Task List**: A list displaying all tasks with their names and descriptions.
- **Buttons for Actions**: You’ll find buttons for adding, editing, highlighting, and deleting tasks right beside each task.
